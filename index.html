<!-- There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.
First identify global variables that will be needed
var Wins = 0
var Losses = 0
var targetNumber = 0
var totalScore = 0

1. create an image file for each of four crysal images.
2. create a html file that contains container, row, and columns for the crystal images
3. in the html file create a reference for each container to a specific crystal image file
4. make sure each crystal image is linked to an ID, for later referencing and jquery
5. make sure each crystal is identified as a button that can be clickd

The player will be shown a random number at the start of the game.
CREATE A BUTTON TO START THE GAME
6. create a space for a random number alert on the html page
7. give that space an ID so that it can be linked to jquery
8. in javascript file, create a random number generator that picks a number between 19 and 120
9. in javascript file, assign each crystal button to a randomly generated value of 1-12

When the player clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 
Your game will hide this amount until the player clicks a crystal.
When they do click one, update the player's score counter.
10. create a calculator in javascript that adds the values from each <button>
11. create a space on the html file to display the calculated total
Note that Derek says it doesn't have to be a button; can be an on click linked to an image

The player wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.
The player loses if their score goes above the random number.
12. create if else statements that identify if the player has won or lost

The game restarts whenever the player wins or loses.
13. this is essentially a clear function
14. make a button for the clear function

When the game begins again, the player should see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.
15. ensure that the random number generator is activated for each reset; the target number and button numbers all have to become randomly generated again

The app should show the number of games the player wins and loses. To that end, do not refresh the page as a means to restart the game.
16. create a variable for wins and for losses; set initial value to 0; update based on other variables for You Win and You Lose

set up all the functions first, then play the game last -->
